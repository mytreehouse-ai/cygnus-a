## Project Structure and Coding Conventions

To maintain a high standard of code quality and ensure the project is easy to navigate and contribute to, we adhere to the following structure and conventions:

### Directory Structure

- **app/auth**: Authentication-related components and logic.
- **components/ui**: Reusable UI components like buttons and inputs.
- **hooks**: Custom React hooks.
- **services** or **api**: API call logic.
- **types**: TypeScript type definitions.
- ****tests****: Unit and integration tests.
- **public** or **assets**: Static assets like images, stylesheets, and fonts.

### Naming Conventions

- Use consistent naming conventions across files and folders (preferably `camelCase` or `kebab-case`).
- Prefix interface names with `I` (e.g., `IUser`).

### Environment Variables

- Store sensitive or environment-specific configurations in environment variables.

### Error Handling

- Implement a consistent error handling strategy across the application.

### Performance Optimization

- Regularly review the application for opportunities to optimize performance.

### Security

- Keep dependencies up to date and use tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit` to identify and fix security issues.

### Documentation

- Keep the project documentation in the `docs` directory or enhance the `README.md` with detailed information about setup, architecture, and contribution guidelines.

By following these guidelines, we can ensure our project remains organized, secure, and easy to work on for all contributors.
