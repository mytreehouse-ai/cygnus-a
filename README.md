## Project Structure and Coding Conventions

To ensure our project remains a beacon of code quality and navigability, we've refined our structure and conventions based on a comprehensive directory scan. Contributors, please align with the following refined guidelines:

### Refined Directory Structure

- **components/ui**: Houses reusable UI components. Aim for modularity.
  - **Example**: `Button.tsx` for a generic button, `Input.tsx` for text input fields.
- **hooks**: For custom React hooks enhancing functionality without clutter.
  - **Example**: `useAuth.ts` for authentication, `useTheme.ts` for theme switching.
- **services/api**: Centralizes API call logic, ensuring clean and maintainable code.
  - **Example**: `authService.ts` for authentication services, `dataFetchService.ts` for fetching data.
- **models**: Defines the shape of data within the application.
  - **Example**: `UserModel.ts`, `InvoiceModel.ts`.
- **utils**: Shared utility functions and modules for cross-project usage.
  - **Example**: `formatDate.ts` for date formatting, `calculateTax.ts` for tax calculations.
- **tests**: Contains both unit and integration tests to maintain code integrity.
  - **Example**: `LoginComponent.test.tsx` for UI tests, `apiService.test.ts` for API logic tests.
- **assets**: Manages static assets including images, stylesheets, and fonts for a cohesive look.
  - **Example**: `logo.png` for the app logo, `theme.css` for global styles.

### Enhanced Naming Conventions

- Adopt `camelCase` for JavaScript files and `kebab-case` for CSS files to maintain uniformity and readability.

### Secure Environment Variables

- Utilize `.env` files to manage sensitive or environment-specific configurations securely.

### Unified Error Handling

- Establish a robust error handling framework to manage exceptions gracefully and maintain application stability.

### Performance Optimization Practices

- Embrace lazy loading for components and images to enhance application speed and user experience.

### Security Measures

- Regularly update dependencies and employ `npm audit` or `yarn audit` for vulnerability checks. Consider using security linters for static code analysis.

### Comprehensive Documentation

- Maintain a `docs` folder for in-depth documentation. Regularly update `README.md` with setup instructions, architectural insights, and contribution guidelines, ensuring clarity and accessibility for new contributors.

### Function Declaration Standards

- Prefer traditional function declarations over arrow functions for lifecycle methods and utilities to enhance code clarity and consistency.
  - **Example**: Use `function fetchData() {}` for API calls instead of `const fetchData = () => {}`. This approach not only makes the code more readable but also ensures that the function is hoisted, allowing it to be used anywhere in the file regardless of where it is declared.

Adhering to these refined guidelines will ensure our project not only remains organized and secure but also becomes more intuitive and accessible for contributors at all levels.
