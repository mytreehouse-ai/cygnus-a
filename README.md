## Project Structure and Coding Conventions

To maintain a high standard of code quality and ensure the project is easy to navigate and contribute to, we adhere to the following structure and conventions:

### Directory Structure

- **components/ui**: Reusable UI components like buttons and inputs.
  - Example: `Button.tsx`, `Input.tsx`
- **hooks**: Custom React hooks.
  - Example: `useLocalStorage.ts`, `useFetch.ts`
- **services** or **api**: API call logic.
  - Example: `userService.ts`, `apiClient.ts`
- **types**: TypeScript type definitions.
  - Example: `User.ts`, `Post.ts`
- **lib**: Shared utility functions and modules.
  - Example: `utils.ts`, `constants.ts`
- \***\*tests\*\***: Unit and integration tests.
  - Example: `User.test.tsx`, `apiClient.test.ts`
- **public** or **assets**: Static assets like images, stylesheets, and fonts.
  - Example: `logo.svg`, `styles.css`

### Naming Conventions

- Use consistent naming conventions across files and folders (preferably `camelCase` or `kebab-case`).

### Environment Variables

- Store sensitive or environment-specific configurations in environment variables.

### Error Handling

- Implement a consistent error handling strategy across the application.

### Performance Optimization

- Regularly review the application for opportunities to optimize performance.

### Security

- Keep dependencies up to date and use tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit` to identify and fix security issues.

### Documentation

- Keep the project documentation in the `docs` directory or enhance the `README.md` with detailed information about setup, architecture, and contribution guidelines.

### Function Declaration

- Limit the use of arrow functions in favor of traditional function declarations when defining component lifecycle methods, utilities, and services to improve readability and standardize the codebase.

By following these guidelines, we can ensure our project remains organized, secure, and easy to work on for all contributors.
